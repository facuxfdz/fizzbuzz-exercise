## Fizzbuzz practice (Exc-1)

> FizzBuzz is a children’s game where

> Here’s the catch: instead of saying

> And instead of saying numbers

This is an exercise, coded in javascript that implements testing with jest.    

## Top-down design:
1. Implement tests thinking in case uses
2. Code the loop from 0 to number (include)
3. Catch edge cases (isNan and lessThan0)
4. Code the fizzbuzz function
5. Abstract "*isMultipleOf*" logic
6. Code the console "*interactive option*"
